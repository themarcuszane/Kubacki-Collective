Aesthetic isn't decoration. It's constraints you can repeat.

## Five rules

- **Dark backgrounds, soft contrast.** Let light earn attention.
- **Motion is punctuation.** It should clarify, not entertain.
- **Typography carries weight.** If the type is right, you need less.
- **Editorial density.** Enough white space to breathe, enough structure to trust.
- **Everything links somewhere.** No dead ends.

If a decision breaks the rules, it needs a strong reason.
